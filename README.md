# Mario Text Based Game
This is a text based game I built using python for my scripting class.

This game uses text input from the user to control the game.

The objective of the game is to have "Mario" search throughout the worlds to pick up 6 mushrooms.
Once the 6 mushrooms are aqcuired you can then enter bowsers castle and win the game.
